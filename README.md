# My Portfolio

This repository is the codebase for my personal portfolio website, found at [https://www.kip-brown.dev/](https://www.kip-brown.dev/). The website is written in [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), and uses the [Quasar Framework](https://quasar.dev/) on top of it. 

I love these packages, they are so easy to use. This is a pretty small app, but I built it from scratch in a day.

## Why Vue?

This is a static website, and a relatively simple one at that. So why use a framework like Vue? Well first, I really enjoy the simplicity of Vue. I pretty new to javascript, but have used html and css for a while, and built a few web apps using the Shiny framework in R. With that limited background, Vue was very easy for me to pick up.

I also REALLY like Vue single file components. The idea of keeping the html, the javascript, and the css all coupled together into small building blocks fits very nicely with my brain. It makes projects, specifically larger projects, easier to maintain IMO.

## Why Quasar

Quasar is a super cool framework. The reason I picked it in the first place is because it has a ton of really cool components, so less work for me! On top of that, I really like that Quasar will allow me to use a single codebase to build many types of apps. This one here is obviously a web page, built as a SPA. But there are a lot of other build options that come with the Quasar CLI.
