# Overview
Lets start with a little back story.

My wife owns a small business called [TinyToesBabyCo](https://www.etsy.com/shop/TinyToesBabyCo) (TTBC). 
It is a baby & toddler boutique. If you're on the market for some baby clothes, check it out,
I guarantee you'll find something like for your little one.

If you made your way to the shop, you'll have seen that it is on Etsy. For those of you that don't
know, Etsy is a platform for people to sell handmade goods. Overall, Etsy is an awesome platform, 
at least according to my wife. One place that she faces some challenges is in their inventory 
managemnt. It brings enough challenges that she was tracking her inventory by hand in an excel file.
Here are the challenges and what this application aims to accomplish.

1. Etsy's inventory is tracked by listing. TTBC has many listings that contain the same product. A good example of this is a blank onesie. This app solves that problem by taking inventory at the product
level.

2. With all of her manual data entry, her products and listings have a lot of inconsistencies. The
app provides a few forms for more structured data entry. 

3. Instead of manually decreasing her inventory on orders, the app automates it. Using Etsy's developer
API's, the app pulls transactions and decreases the inventory.

4. Estimate time until empty on here inventory based on historic sales patterns (Coming Soon).

5. Product sales dashboard to better understand here size, pattern, and product trends (Coming Soon).
