I very much consider myself a generalist in the data science space. Sometimes I develop solutions using machine learning, sometimes I am a data journalist, sometimes I build analytical dashboards.'

      description: 'My background in mathematics and statistics introduced me to data science. Data science then introduced me to developing software, and I quickly became enfatuated with the field. I work primaly on web development and data engineering projects, but also enjoy tinkering with whatever new and shiny tech I can find. I am constantly learning new things and trying to improve the quality of the code that I write.'

      description: "This is the area where I have the least amount of experience. That being said, I  really like being self sufficient in what I do. In reality, this machine learning model doesn't do much good in a notebook on my computer. Or this app isn't helping anybody running on 127.0.0.1. I enjoy being able to take something that I have built and make it useful by operationalizing whatever it is that I am working on."
